# Description

This app allowed for the final developer showdown to happen. From scratch, student is tasked with building a full-fledged web application that incorporates the Model-View-Controller (MVC) framwork. Student was to demonstrate their ability to build a self-sustaining front and back end application, however, the coding dynamic needed to follow the conventional MVC structure. This included the use of express handlebars to build off of the last challenge and implement a front-facing user-interface. It also added the use of login/logout functionality where authorizations were incorporated into the code. App is deployed to heroku to engage in UX.

The web app displays a blog-type user interface where user can land on a polished web page where they can sign up to create an account, login/logout, and view and create blog posts. User is also able to jump from their own dashboard to a public homepage. User can also add and view comments on each blog post.
